### 💡 Pro-Tips for Best Recognition:
1. **Lighting**: Ensure your room is well-lit so the camera can cleanly recognize joints!
2. **Stability**: Hold static gestures smoothly. An integrated debounce buffer blocks rapid-fire errors.
3. **Transitions**: The screen displays one immersive object at a time. Triggering a new gesture seamlessly replaces the current cosmos with the new selection.
4. **Colors**: Trying to get a specific visual style? Just re-trigger the object to spawn a randomized stationary color matching your cinematic vibe!
